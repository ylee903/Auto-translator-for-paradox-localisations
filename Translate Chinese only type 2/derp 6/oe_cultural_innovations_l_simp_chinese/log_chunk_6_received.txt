ID005 Warty Armor  
ID006 The Qiang people's skill in forging armor is unmatched in the world.

The end of the armor is left unworked for about a chopstick's length, remaining hidden like a wart, to exemplify the thickness before forging, just as soil is left unmoved at the riverbed. It is known as “Warty Armor.” It cannot be penetrated even by strong crossbows.

ID004 Celtic

ID006 Anglo-Saxon Select Militia
ID007 During the earlier chaotic periods of migration and settlement, wars were led by small amounts of personal guard warriors. By the 8th century, the leaders of the Anglo-Saxons had established their own kingdoms. Therefore, in a sense, greater logistical efforts were required to defend their lands and wage war. As a solution, the Anglo-Saxons began to implement what was called the "select fyrd."

ID020 Bread and Mead
ID021 The lord distributes bread to his followers, symbolizing the bond and loyalty between the lord and his warriors.

ID022 Book of Winchester
ID023 The Book of Winchester, also known as the Domesday Book, is a compilation of land surveys across England.

ID028 Iberian City Militia
ID029 The role of the Iberian city militia during the mid-Middle Ages is noteworthy. Born in the border conflict areas, local militias served the monarchs on the peninsula, and when faced with various urgent situations, they could quickly bolster their strength. Whether militarily, economically, or in constraining the influence of local nobles, city militias provided greater flexibility for the king's decisions.

ID035 We have inherited the combat methods of the Visigoth era, focusing primarily on cavalry units, emphasizing proficiency in mounted combat.

ID038 Spanish Phalanx
ID039 To consolidate land supremacy in Iberia, we must undertake an infantry revolution, as history has shown—well-organized infantry tactics can handle all battlefield environments.

Households raising horses can be exempted from certain taxes. Ten households of third class or above form a protection unit; ten households of fourth class or below form a community. If a horse from the protection unit dies due to illness, the household raising it is solely responsible for compensation; if a horse from the community dies due to illness, the household raising it will share half the compensation with the other nine households.

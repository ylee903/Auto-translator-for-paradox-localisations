ID006 盎格鲁—撒克逊精选民兵
ID007 早先在迁徙和定居期间的混乱时期战争是由少量的亲卫军战士主导的，而到了8世纪，盎格鲁—撒克逊人的领袖们已经有了自己的既定王国。所以从某种意义上说，需要付出更大的后勤努力来保护自己的土地和进行战争。作为一种解决方案，盎格鲁-撒克逊人开始实施所谓的“选拔的自由民兵（select fyrd）”。
ID008 组织亲卫

ID004 Celtic  
ID005 The Celts are a loose group of ancient European people bound together by a common language and cultural traditions, belonging to the ancient ethnic groups. They have repeatedly resisted invasions and have not yielded to outsiders, as if all of this is ingrained in their bones.  
ID006 Anglo-Saxon Select Militia  
ID007 In the chaotic period of migration and settlement, wars were led by a few prestigious warrior guards, and by the 8th century, the leaders of the Anglo-Saxons had established their own kingdoms. Therefore, in a sense, there was a need for greater logistical efforts to protect their lands and engage in warfare. As a solution, the Anglo-Saxons began to implement the so-called "select fyrd".  
ID008 Organize Guards  
ID009 During the chaos of the Germanic people's massive migration to England, tribal leaders and kings would summon their selected strong warriors, who possessed the best weapons and equipment, and who were also the king's household soldiers, trained specifically for warfare.

ID014 Highland Clans

ID016 Hire Foreign Warriors  
ID017 The Gales of the northern Highlands of Scotland are incredibly fierce; they are unmatched combat zealots who are willing to fight for money. Most importantly, they seldom involve themselves in our local political struggles; as long as the price is right, they will obediently follow orders.  
ID018 House of Warriors  
ID019 The northern Highlands of Scotland have always been the home of the Gales, and our warriors are more than willing to fight for their homeland.  
ID020 Bread and Mead  
ID021 The lord distributes bread to his followers, symbolizing the connection and loyalty between the lord and his warriors.

ID022 Winchester Book  
ID023 The Winchester Book, also known as the Domesday Book, is a compilation of a nationwide land survey in England. Its purpose is to understand the land situation of royal demesne and the lands of the king's immediate vassals, so as to collect taxes, strengthen fiscal management, and define the vassals' feudal obligations.

ID028 Iberian City Militia  
ID029 The role of the Iberian city militia in the mid-Middle Ages is worth noting. Born out of local militias in border disputes, they serve the monarchs of the peninsula and can rapidly expand their strength in various urgent situations. Whether in military or economic matters, or in constraining local nobility, city militias provide greater flexibility for the king's decisions.  
ID030 Spanish Grand Landowners  
ID031 As the Iberian region gradually gains liberation, we grant land ownership rights to loyal lords under our command while exempting them from certain taxes; in return, they are responsible for providing cavalry forces needed for the subsequent series of recovery wars.

ID036 Catalonia Mercenaries

ID038 Spanish Phalanx

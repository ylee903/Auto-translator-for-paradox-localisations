ID044 我的信使告诉我：北方战士们很快就到！
ID045 瓦兰吉战士到来
ID046 一艘又一艘形态各异的长船停靠于港口内，剽悍的北方战士鱼贯而出，他们身上的锁子甲在阳光下折射出血污死寂般的铁黑色，我不敢相信自己的眼睛，这些强大的战士即将为我所用！\n\n我挺挺胸膛，努力摆出一位王者应有的姿态。我试图从他们深凹的眼眶里找出一丝畏惧——对于一位正站在他们面前的活生生的皇帝的畏惧。\n\n这些北方人丝毫不避讳我的目光，就这么直勾勾的与我对视。\n\n天哪！这些人的目光真让人头皮发麻......

ID000 Public Outrage (ai)  
ID001 People's Anger  
ID002 Years of war and debt have left me on edge. Finally, just today, my guards stumbled in to tell me: angry citizens are gathering to overthrow my rule! \nI have not treated them poorly, why do they do this to me! \nThose damn filthy commoners!  
ID003 I need to quickly think of a way to appease them.  
ID004 My spokesperson has brought the news that the public's anger has eased, and they even donated a batch of supplies to me.  
ID005 My speech was terrible, I'm finished.  
ID006 Send out the army, let the commoners see the power of the sword!  
ID007 My guards charged into the crowd and killed a few troublemakers with wild slashes.  
ID008 The fighting ability of the commoners is beyond my imagination, I'm finished.  
ID009 Let them be.  
ID010 Things are getting more and more out of your control.  
ID011 Hold a grand parade.  
ID012 My army needs me, my people need me, my vassals need me. \nI have prepared a grand parade, and it is sure to have a great effect.  
ID013 The parade is progressing smoothly.  
ID014 Prepare for the parade!  
ID015 Let's start!  
ID016 Grand Parade  
ID017 The parade site is crowded, with departments lined up waiting for inspection. I have prepared many speeches, ready to deliver a message of consolation once the parade is over. \nBut it is getting late, and time is running out. Who should I address first?  
ID018 Start with the brave warriors who charge ahead from my side.  
ID019 I should be more approachable to the lower-tier warriors.  
ID020 Without my dear vassals, there would be no today for me!  
ID021 My bravest warriors all chant long live, and even from this distance I can still feel their enthusiasm.

ID041 Where are my loyal warriors?!  
ID042 A batch of Varangian warriors will soon come to pay a visit... \nYour reputation has spread widely among the northern people, and there will be [GetMaA('walanjiweidui').GetName][men_at_arms|E] available for your command for the next 20 years.  
ID043 I need to establish a powerful and loyal royal guard!  
ID044 My messenger tells me: the northern warriors will arrive soon!  
ID045 Varangian warriors have arrived.  
ID046 Ship after ship of various longboats dock at the port, and fierce northern warriors stream out. The chainmail on them reflects a blood-stained, deathly iron black in the sunlight. I can hardly believe my eyes; these powerful warriors are about to serve me! \n\nI puff out my chest, trying to appear as a king should. I attempt to find a trace of fear in their deep-set eyes—fear of a living emperor standing before them. \n\nThese northerners do not shy away from my gaze and stare directly at me. \n\nMy God! Their gaze is truly chilling...  
ID047 What fearless and powerful warriors...  
ID048 Mercenaries Massacring Cities  
ID049 A group of crazed mercenaries ransacked [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], taking everything local, leaving not a single survivor... \nClearly, these mercenaries were not satisfied with the rewards I offered.

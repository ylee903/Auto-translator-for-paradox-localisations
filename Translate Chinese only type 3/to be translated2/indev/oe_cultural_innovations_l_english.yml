During the Wu Zhou period, the hundred were expanded to a thousand, and during the Zhongzong era, they were expanded to ten thousand, divided into left and right camps, with commanders appointed. After Zhongzong's death, Xuanzong, with the support of the ten-thousand-man leader Ge Fushun, exterminated the factions of Empress Wei and Princess Anle and appointed Ruizong as emperor. After Xuanzong ascended the throne, the ten-thousand-man left and right camps and the left and right Imperial Guard were collectively known as the Northern Four Armies. In the twenty-seventh year of Kaiyuan, the ten-thousand-man left and right camps were officially renamed the left and right Dragon Military#!"

We indulge in pleasure and are addicted to the opulence of ephemeral enjoyment. Even if there are good pastures cultivated by earlier generations, a source of horses, and a complete equestrian system, the current ruling class is indeed very passive and neglectful of equestrian policy.

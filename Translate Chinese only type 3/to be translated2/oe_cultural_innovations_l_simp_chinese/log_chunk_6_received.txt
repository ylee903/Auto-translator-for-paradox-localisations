During Wu Zhou's time, this was expanded to a thousand, and during Zhongzong's time, it further expanded to ten thousand, divided into left and right camps, with officers as commanders. After Zhongzong's death, Xuanzong, with the support of the ten thousand riders' leader Ge Fushun, eliminated the faction of Empress Wei and Princess Anle, and nominated Ruizong as emperor. After Xuanzong ascended the throne, the ten thousand riders' left and right camps were collectively referred to as the Four Armies of the North Gate. In the 27th year of Kaiyuan, the ten thousand riders' left and right camps were officially renamed the Longwu Army.#

ID000521 Revitalize the horse management (ai).  
ID000522 Revitalize the horse management.  
ID000523 #F The Sixteen Prefectures of Yanyun have been seized by the northern nomadic states. After the establishment of the Song Dynasty, we lost this fertile land that nurtures horses, leading to a decline in our horse management. Although Taizu Zhao Kuangyin established a sound horse management system, with the stability of the Northern Song dynasty, domestic institutions functioned smoothly, and the economy and culture thrived. The ruling class of the Song Dynasty has been in peacetime for a long time, and we seem to have forgotten the importance of horse management during times of war. We indulge in pleasures, getting lost in the extravagance of money, even if there are good pastures cultivated by our predecessors and a complete horse management system. However, the current ruling class is indeed very passive and neglectful towards horse management. Our neglect of the horse management system is increasingly influencing the attitudes of the officials below, and their directives and decisions, which are detrimental to horse management, are fundamentally responsible for the gradual decline of horse management afterwards.#

ID000525 Implement the Horse Protection Law...  
ID000526 Enact the Horse Protection Law, benefiting future generations!  
ID000527 Enact the Horse Protection Law!  
ID000528 It is stipulated that in Hebei, Hedong, Shaanxi, Jingdong, the five routes and various counties within Kaifeng Prefecture, households should keep one horse, and those with abundant resources and willing should keep two horses, provided with official horses or given funds to purchase. Households raising horses can be exempted from certain taxes. Ten households of third class or higher form one protection unit, while households of fourth class or lower form one community. If a horse from a protection unit dies from illness, the unit will compensate individually; if a horse from the community dies, the unit and the other nine households will share the cost.

ID000547 The public is outraged.  
ID000548 Years of war and debt have made me tense. Finally, today, my guards burst in, telling me: angry citizens are rallying to overthrow my rule!  
I have treated them well. Why are they doing this to me!  
These damned lowly people!  
ID000549 I must quickly think of a way to appease them.  
ID000550 My emissary has brought news that the public's anger has calmed, and they even donated a batch of supplies to me.  
ID000551 My speech was terrible. I'm finished.  
ID000552 Send out the military to show these filthy commoners the power of the sword!  
ID000553 My guards charged into the crowd, killing several ringleaders with their swords.  
ID000554 The fighting ability of these commoners exceeds my expectations. I'm finished.  
ID000555 Let them be.  
ID000556 Things are getting more and more out of your control.  
ID000557 Hold a grand military parade.  
ID000558 My army needs me, my people need me, my vassals need me.

ID000559 The military parade is progressing smoothly.  
ID000560 Prepare for the military parade!  
ID000561 Let’s begin!  
ID000562 Grand military parade.  
ID000563 The parade site is buzzing with people as each department lines up, waiting for the review. I have prepared many speeches, just waiting to express my condolences after the parade.  
But the sky is getting dark, and there's not much time left. Who should I address first?  
ID000564 Start with the brave warriors who charge forward under my command.  
ID000565 I should appear closer to the grassroots warriors.  
ID000566 Without my dear vassals, there would be no today for me!  
ID000567 My bravest warriors shout long live together; even from this distance, I can still feel their enthusiasm.  
ID000568 Subspace demons.  
ID000569 Torture and blood-sucking demons.  
ID000570 #F The tribes that worship torture are filled with ferocious blood-sucking demons. They are lethal warriors, holding high status among the mortal believers of the blood god. They are incredibly furious, thirsting for blood, just like torture descending to the world. During battle, they rush quickly, slaughtering enemies one by one, then swiftly leaving to find new foes. Every time a blood-sucking demon slays an enemy, it lets out a shout; the terrifying roar echoes across the battlefield, leaving all who hear it horrified.#  
ID000571 Lustful heart chasers.  
ID000572 #F The heart chasers indulge in pleasure, cruel and vicious. They love to torment unfortunate mortals, making them uncomfortable, and chase them across rugged mountains and rivers. Just when they seem about to succeed, they will pause the chase, allowing the prey to regain strength and giving them a glimmer of hope for escape. This hunting can last for months or even years, pushing mortals' spirits and bodies to the brink of collapse. Mortals only yield to them after their mental breakdown, allowing them to stop the hunt and take the mortals' souls back to the chaotic demon realms.#

ID000593 I need to form a strong and loyal imperial guard!  
ID000594 My messenger tells me: the northern warriors will arrive soon!  
ID000595 The Varangian warriors have arrived.  
ID000596 One after another, long ships of various shapes dock at the port, fierce northern warriors pour out, their chainmail reflecting the blood-soaked, dead-like iron black under the sunlight. I can hardly believe my eyes; these powerful warriors are about to be at my service!  
I puff my chest and try to present myself with the demeanor of a king. I seek a hint of fear from their deep-set eyes—fear of a living emperor standing before them.  
These northern people do not shy away from my gaze, staring straight at me.  
Heavens! The gaze of these men is truly chilling...  
ID000597 What fearless and powerful warriors...  
ID000598 Mercenary city slaughter.  
ID000599 A group of crazy mercenaries ransacked [county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], taking everything local, leaving not a single survivor...  
Clearly, these mercenaries are not satisfied with the rewards I have given.

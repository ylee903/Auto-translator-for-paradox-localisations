ID000525 Revitalize Horse Politics (ai)
ID000526 Revitalize Horse Politics
ID000527 #F The sixteen prefectures of Yanyun have been taken by the northern nomadic regimes. After the establishment of the Song Dynasty, losing Yanyun, a prime land for raising horses, our horse politics have diminished significantly. Although Emperor Taizu Zhao Kuangyin established a sound horse policy, as the Northern Song Dynasty stabilized and the internal systems were smoothly operating, the economy and culture flourished. The ruling class of the Song Dynasty, having been in peace for a long time, seems to have forgotten the importance of horse politics during wartime. Indulging in decadence, they obsessed over the pleasures of life, neglecting horse farms and sources cultivated by predecessors, resulting in a significant downturn. The current regime's ruling class's negligence and apathy toward horse politics are the fundamental reasons for the ongoing decline of horse politics. This oversight has influenced lower officials' attitudes, leading to unfavorable policies and decisions for horse politics, exacerbating its collapse. #!

ID000531 Promulgate the Horse Protection Act!
ID000532 Regulate the counties of Hebei, Hedong, Shaanxi, Jingdong, the five western roads, and Kaifeng to maintain a horse-raising system. Each household should raise one horse, and those with abundant resources may raise two voluntarily, either provided by the government or purchased with government funds. Horse-raising households may receive tax exemptions. Ten households from the top three classes form one group, and ten households from the fourth class form one community. If a household's horse dies, the household must compensate alone; if a community horse dies, the household and the nine other households share half the compensation.\n\nBy my decree: Promulgate the Horse Protection Act!

ID000558 Years of war and debt have left me on edge. Finally, today, my guards stumbled in to tell me: furious citizens are holding an assembly, preparing to overthrow my rule!\nI have not treated them unfairly; why would they do this to me!\nDamn these wretched peasants!
ID000559 I must quickly think of a way to appease them.
ID000560 My spokesperson brought the news: the people's anger has subsided, and they even donated a batch of supplies to me.
ID000561 My speech was terrible; I'm done for.
ID000562 Send the troops; let the peasants see the power of swords!
ID000563 My guards rushed into the crowd and hacked to death several ringleaders.
ID000564 The peasants' fighting capacity exceeded my expectations; I'm done for.
ID000565 Let them be.
ID000566 Things are increasingly getting out of your control.
ID000567 Hold a Grand Parade

ID000576 Without my beloved vassals, I wouldn't be here today!
ID000577 My bravest warriors shouted long live in unison; even at such a distance, I can still feel their enthusiasm.
ID000578 Warp Space Demon
ID000579 Khornate Bloodletter
ID000580 #F Khornate Bloodletters are ferocious warriors within the Khorne-worshipping tribes, holding a high status among Khorne's mortal followers. They are extremely furious, thirsting for blood, just as Khorne does. During battle, they charge swiftly, cutting the enemy in half one after another, then quickly move on to find new foes. With each enemy they slay, they let out a terrifying roar that echoes across the battlefield, striking fear into all who hear it. #!
ID000581 Slaanesh Seeker
ID000582 #F The Seekers of Slaanesh are sadistically cruel, reveling in torment. They delight in toying with unfortunate mortals, driving them to despair, and will chase them across mountains and rivers. Just when their prey is about to give up, they pause, allowing them to regain some strength and hope for escape. This hunt can last for months or even years, pushing mortals to the brink of mental and physical collapse. Only when a mortal's spirit is entirely broken will they succumb to the Seekers, who will then stop the hunt and drag their souls back to the Chaos Realm. #!

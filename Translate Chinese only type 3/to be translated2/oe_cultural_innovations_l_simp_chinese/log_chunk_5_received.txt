ID000424 Issue the Horse Preservation Law, benefit future generations!
ID000425 Issue the Horse Preservation Law!
ID000426 It is stipulated that Hebei, Hedong, Shaanxi, Jidong, the five western routes, and all counties within Kaifeng Prefecture shall maintain horses under the Baojia system, one horse per household, and two for those with high capability and willing. They are provided with government horses, or allowed to buy their own with government funds. Households maintaining horses can reduce some taxes. For households above the third rank, ten households form one Bao; for those below the fourth rank, ten households form one She. If a horse in a Bao household dies of illness, the horse-owning household compensates alone; if a horse in a She household dies of illness, the horse-owning household and the other nine households compensate half each.\n\nBy my decree: implement the Horse Preservation Law!

I can't believe my eyes; these powerful warriors will soon be under my command!\n\nI straighten my chest, trying to show the posture a king should have.

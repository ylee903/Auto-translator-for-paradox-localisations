During Wu Zhou's time, this was expanded to a thousand, and during Zhongzong's time, it further expanded to ten thousand, divided into left and right camps, with officers as commanders. After Zhongzong's death, Xuanzong, with the support of the ten thousand riders' leader Ge Fushun, eliminated the faction of Empress Wei and Princess Anle, and nominated Ruizong as emperor. After Xuanzong ascended the throne, the ten thousand riders' left and right camps were collectively referred to as the Four Armies of the North Gate.

After the establishment of the Song Dynasty, we lost this fertile land that nurtures horses, leading to a decline in our horse management. Although Taizu Zhao Kuangyin established a sound horse management system, with the stability of the Northern Song dynasty, domestic institutions functioned smoothly, and the economy and culture thrived. The ruling class of the Song Dynasty has been in peacetime for a long time, and we seem to have forgotten the importance of horse management during times of war. We indulge in pleasures, getting lost in the extravagance of money, even if there are good pastures cultivated by our predecessors and a complete horse management system. However, the current ruling class is indeed very passive and neglectful towards horse management. Our neglect of the horse management system is increasingly influencing the attitudes of the officials below, and their directives and decisions, which are detrimental to horse management, are fundamentally responsible for the gradual decline of horse management afterwards.#"

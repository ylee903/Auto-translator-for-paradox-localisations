ID000527: #F The sixteen prefectures of Yanyun have been taken by the northern nomadic regimes. After the establishment of the Song Dynasty, losing Yanyun, a prime land for raising horses, our horse politics have diminished significantly. Although Emperor Taizu Zhao Kuangyin established a sound horse policy, as the Northern Song Dynasty stabilized and the internal systems were smoothly operating, the economy and culture flourished. The ruling class of the Song Dynasty, having been in peace for a long time, seems to have forgotten the importance of horse politics during wartime. Indulging in decadence, they obsessed over the pleasures of life, neglecting horse farms and sources cultivated by predecessors, resulting in a significant downturn. The current regime's ruling class's negligence and apathy toward horse politics are the fundamental reasons for the ongoing decline of horse politics. This oversight has influenced lower officials' attitudes, leading to unfavorable policies and decisions for horse politics, exacerbating its collapse. #!

Although Taizu Zhao Kuangyin established a sound horse management system, with the stability of the Northern Song dynasty, domestic institutions functioned smoothly, and the economy and culture thrived. The ruling class of the Song Dynasty has been in peacetime for a long time, and we seem to have forgotten the importance of horse management during times of war. We indulge in pleasures, getting lost in the extravagance of money, even if there are good pastures cultivated by our predecessors and a complete horse management system. However, the current ruling class is indeed very passive and neglectful towards horse management. Our neglect of the horse management system is increasingly influencing the attitudes of the officials below, and their directives and decisions, which are detrimental to horse management, are fundamentally responsible for the gradual decline of horse management afterwards.#

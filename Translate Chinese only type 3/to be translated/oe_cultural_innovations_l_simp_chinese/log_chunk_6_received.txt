Exhausted March
Soaked through by rain and mud, heavy armor burdened the soldiers. The long march left their eyes bloodshot and legs trembling. Faces filled with fatigue and anxiety, their eyes dimmed, lacking the sharpness of yesteryears. Weapons became heavy and clumsy, swords covered in dirt and stains. Every step felt like carrying a thousand pounds, the horses panted, their heavy breaths intermingling with the marching troops.#!
Speed up, you lazy pigs!
Move it! You lazy pigs! Tonight, those who fall behind get no food!
Your remarkable military experience taught you how to effectively mobilize the entire army.
The soldiers loudly complained about the hardship of the march and ignored your urgings.
Alright, make camp and rest.
Ambush
The sky darkened, clouds gathered, visibility grew worse, and the sounds of iron armor echoed among the troops.\n\nSuddenly, a loud shout pierced the silence, several shadows darted forth, swords and spears gleaming.\n\n\n"Ambush!"#!
Hold formation!
Find a way to capture the scouts to delay the enemy's next move.
You remained eerily calm, seizing the right moment to capture the enemyâ€™s scouts.
You were paralyzed with indecision, the enemy struck and withdrew, leaving you vulnerable on the forthcoming path.
Sally out to meet the enemy
The distant fortress came into view.\nTall walls crowned with clear banners signaling danger ahead.\n\nSuddenly, the gate slowly opened, and a troop emerged, forming a tight formation like a wall of steel, quietly waiting for our arrival.\n\n
Charge!
Believe in my soldiers and charge through!

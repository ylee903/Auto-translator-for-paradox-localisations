Mole Armor
The Qiang people excel at forging armor, with the initial forging process being very thick. Unlike hot forging, it's cold forged, and the final product is thinner than the original by one-third. The unfinished end, left without hammering, appears as a "mole," a method to check the thickness before completion, much like leaving some soil when deepening a river. This is known as "Mole Armor." Even a strong crossbow cannot penetrate it.

The Song people even regarded Tangut horses as the best in the world.
Cold Forged Steel
The Tangut's steel forging techniques were unparalleled. It was a supreme honor to possess a sword from the Xia Kingdom. The Song Emperor Qinzong himself carried a treasured sword from the Xia Kingdom. Su Dongpo once received a Western Xia sword and wrote: "Red makeup on the seat dazzles with wine, green blade unsheathed brings wind. Spiral blade ridged, two white dragons flank a central blue dragon. Testing a hair, it cuts without soul, stirring three moves of awe."
Ronin

Three top ranking households form a security unit; lower ranking households form a community. If a horse dies due to illness, the horsekeeping household compensates; community horse casualties are shared equally among ten households.\n\nBy the Emperor's decree: Proclaim the Horse Law!

Public Outcry
Years of war and debt have frayed my nerves. Finally, today, my guard stumbled in to tell me: angry citizens are gathering, preparing to overthrow my rule!\nI have not treated them poorly, why are they doing this to me!\nThese damn peasants!
Quickly think of a way to appease them.
My spokesperson brought news that the people's anger has subsided, and they even donated some supplies to me.

The empire's strong armor technology has equipped these long-distance mercenaries from the steppes. Although they sacrificed some pursuit ability, their defense has been greatly enhanced.

Our knights possess unparalleled resolution, and our people will sing of their great deeds for a long time.
Heavy Lancer Cavalry
The group charge of heavy lancer cavalry is unstoppable; even the sturdiest battle formations will turn to ashes in an instant.
Foot Feudal Knights
On battlefields where cavalry cannot be deployed, our fearless knights still fight tenaciously.
Light Lancer Cavalry
Light lancer cavalry from Burgundy, combining explosiveness and mobility, is excellent for flank attacks.

Muscovite Estate System
The development of the feudal society in the Rus’ region differs from that of Western Europe.

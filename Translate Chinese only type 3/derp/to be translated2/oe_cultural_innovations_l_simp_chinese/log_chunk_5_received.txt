ID000423 Implement horse protection laws...  
ID000424 Enact the horse protection laws, benefiting future generations!  
ID000425 Enact the horse protection laws!  
ID000426 Regulations state that in Hebei, Hedong, Shaanxi, Jingdong, the five routes of the West, and various counties within Kaifeng, households should keep one horse; those with sufficient resources and willing may keep two horses, receiving government horses or funds to buy their own. Horse-keeping households may be exempted from certain taxes. Ten households of grade three or above form one unit, and ten households of grade four or below form one group. If a horse in unit dies due to illness, the horse-keeping household is solely responsible for compensation; if a horse in a group dies due to illness, the horse-keeping household and the other nine households share the costs.  
By my decree: Enact the horse protection laws!

ID000451 The people are angered  
ID000452 Years of war and debt have left me on edge. Finally, today, my guard stumbled in to tell me: Angry crowds are gathering to overthrow my rule!  
I have treated them well, why are they doing this to me!  
These damned commoners!  
ID000453 I must quickly think of a way to placate them.  
ID000454 My spokesperson has brought news that the people's anger has calmed, and they even donated supplies to me.  
ID000455 My speech was terrible, I'm finished.  
ID000456 Deploy the army, let those commoners witness the power of swords!

But it is getting late, time is limited; who should I address first?  
ID000468 Let’s start with the brave warriors who charge ahead under my command.  
ID000469 I should appear closer to the grassroots warriors.  
ID000470 Without my dear vassals, there would be no today for me!

ID000495 Varangian warriors have arrived  
ID000496 Ship after ship of varying longships dock in the harbor, and fierce northern warriors surge out. Their chain mail reflects a blood-stained, death-like black under the sun. I can hardly believe my eyes, these powerful warriors are about to be at my service!  
   
I puff out my chest, striving to maintain the posture of a king. I try to look for some fear in their deeply sunken eyes—fear towards a living emperor standing right in front of them.  
   
These northerners do not shy away from my gaze, staring directly back at me.
